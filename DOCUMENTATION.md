# The Project 

The idea smart AI survival helper tool, off the grid being able to used in any situation in the wilderness

Aim for MVP 1.5-2 weeks before submission deadline August 31st.

Deadline is September 11th

# Rules

- Provide a public code repository (with README), clear indication of gpt-oss model usage
- Include a demo video (<3 minutes, YouTube link)
- Project must run on intended platform and work as described
- Multiple submissions allowed if each is unique and substantially different

# Milestone & Timeline

- [ ] Finalize requirements – Aug 18
- [ ] Hardware assembly complete – Aug 22
- [ ] MVP demo complete – Aug 31
- [ ] Final video & polish – Sep 8

# Components

- Solar Panel
- Battery Pack
- Touch Screen
- Camera
- RaspberryPI

# Rules to Consider and Details

Entries will be judged on the following equally-weighted criteria, and according to the sole and absolute discretion of the judges:

- Application of gpt-oss - Does the project apply the open models in an effective way, fitting with the categories? Can other models do the same thing, or does the project showcase the strengths of the models uniquely?
- Design - Is the user experience and design of the project well thought-out, including safety of the user? Is there a balanced blend of frontend and backend?
- Potential Impact - How big of an impact could the project have for its intended audience? How big of an impact could it have beyond the target community and the rest of the world?
- Novelty of the Idea - How creative and unique is the project? Does the concept exist already? If so, how much does the project improve on it?

# Tech Stack

# Deployment/Setup Instructions

- To be documented: wiring diagram, required packages, setup steps

# Test Plan

- AI outputs: scenario-based validation
- Hardware: field testing for solar + battery
